An Australian father who is believed to have been brainwashed by the preachings of Islamic extremist Musa Cerantonio has joined the ranks of terror group Islamic State to fight in the Middle East. According to Twitter, Zia Abdul Haq's current location is in an IS-controlled area of Ash-Shaam, also known as Syria. Friends of the 33-year-old believed the man from Logan - south of Brisbane - was moving to Syria to look for a new wife after the breakdown of his marriage, but The Courier Mail has revealed Abdul Haq is in fact fighting with the extremist organisation. Scroll down for video . The friends of Zia Abdul Haq says the father-of-one, from Logan, is a 'good-hearted guy' Two of Australia's most notorious jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar are part of the same group. Abdul Haq is one of the latest of three men who are believed to have joined IS, including Melbourne's Abu Khaled al-Cambodi and Mounir Raad. The 33-year-old's friends described him as a 'good-hearted guy' but had been 'brainwashed' by Cerantonio - who is believed to be an influential IS figure - after hearing the radical sheik speak in Brisbane two years ago. The 33-year-old's friends claim he was brainwashed by prominent IS supporter, Musa Cerantonio - a radical sheik . 'He wasnâ€™t a bad guy but he fell off the rails and under the spell of the extremists,' friend Yehya El-Kholed told The Courier Mail. 'Sheik Cerantonio is a hypocrite because while he urges people to go to Syria, he wonâ€™t go himself.' Since he landed in Syria, Abdul Haq - who came to Australia in his 20s and took up a job as a finance officer - has been actively posting photos depicting life as a fighter for IS on the social media site. These include M16 training, jihadists playing violent video games and cooking up a shared meal. But like Sharrouf and Elomar, Abdul Haq - who has a young son - has used Twitter as platform to fire off threatening messages, including one to foreign forces to 'bring dead body bag for each of your soldiers'. Most recently, he took aim at the U.S. saying 'Send you (men) to fight us, your drones are useless on the ground'  and 'How come you fight #IS with your gays & lesbians army' on Saturday night. Abdul Haq has also hit back at media outlets circulating news about him. 'Many lies about me in Australian news. =/,' he tweeted within half an hour of reports emerging. Since arriving in Syria Abdul Haq has been posting photos on Twitter of what it is like being an IS fighter . Last month Musa Cerantonio was deported back to Australia from the Philippines after he was arrested after breaching the Philippines' immigration laws. Changing his name from Robert Edward, the 29-year-old was detained in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he was believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming on Twitter he had arrived in the Middle East just days before his arrest. He was found with a Filipino fashion designer claiming to be his wife, inside an apartment. Australian authorities cancelled his passport, triggering his arrest and leaving without any documentation. He was then set free when he arrived in Melbourne after deportation as he had not broken any Australian laws. Musa Cerantonio is thought to be an influential IS figure and Abdul Haq is believed to have taken up extremist views after hearing the sheik speak in 2012 in Brisbane .Jerusalem woke up on Tuesday to horrific images of slain Jewish worshipers, and scores injured in a terror attack on a synagogue. The assault which took place in the western Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof, shocked Israel to the core, as well as many others around the world. This is not surprising considering both the brutality of the attack and the fact it was carried out in a holy place, where innocent religious people were worshiping. The two assailants, cousins from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber, were shot dead by the Israeli security forces. The incident in addition to the ongoing violence since the beginning of summer, left the city of Jerusalem more divided than for a long time. The attack this week should have also sent a clear message to both leaderships that if they will not take measures to calm the situation down, further escalation and worse violence is around the corner. Regrettably, the Hamas praised the attack in Jerusalem and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the situation as the "Battle for Jerusalem." He also accused the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas of involvement despite the latter's condemnation of the killing. Both sides are employing inflammable language, although it is hard to blame the Palestinian president for feeling angry considering Israeli behavior since the collapse of the peace process in April. To make things worse, it emerged in recent days that Israel has also decided to return to a policy of demolishing houses of terrorists' families, even if they were killed during the attack. The Israeli security establishment argues that this form of punishment serves as a deterrence for any other would-be assailants. Regardless of the fate they face, their families are going to pay a heavy price and will be left homeless. In a society where three generations of one family might live under the same roof, one act harms quite a few people, from babies to the elderly.  To prove the seriousness of their intentions, the Israeli security forces already demolished a home on Wednesday. The home in Silwan was that of the Palestinian who drove his car into a crowd last month, killing two people. He was killed in the attack. The Army also moved to demolish the houses of the two who carried out the killing at the synagogue in Jerusalem. Ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the Israeli army.  A report produced, following an investigation by the Israeli security establishment, found this action counter-productive. There is actually evidence that house demolition led to a rise in the number of attacks. House demolition of Palestinian militants' houses is a form of collective punishment and an act of revenge, concealed behind a claim of deterrence. A similar "standard" was never applied to a Jewish terrorist. For instance when a  Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein, slayed 29 Muslim worshipers in the Cave of Patriarchs, no one suggested to demolish his home as a deterrence. According to the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem, in the height of the Second Intifada, between 2001-2005, 664 Palestinian homes were demolished in the occupied Palestinian territories as an apparent deterrence. There is no evidence that the misery inflicted on thousands of innocent Palestinians enhanced Israeli security. It is worth remembering that the demolition of Palestinian houses in the West Bank also takes place for the purpose of expanding settlements, something which aggravates an already hostile population. Arbitrary house demolitions represent not only a bad policy, but are also illegal and immoral. This is a clear violation of international law, more specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention, clearly prohibits forcing individuals and groups out of their homes within an occupied territory. Any demolition of houses when there are no overwhelming military reasons is regarded as a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and could potentially lead to a war crime charge. And there is also, of course, a moral aspect. As deplorable as some of the acts committed by a few individuals, their punishment should not extend beyond their death or what the court decides. Their families, as a result, suffered a loss too, for no fault of their own. To condemn them to destitution for an act that they did not commit is a moral travesty. The decision by the Israelis to resume Palestinian house demolition following an attack on Jews in Israel is not a security decision but a political one, aimed to satisfy an angry public and extreme right-wing members of the current coalition. The Israeli coalition depends on satisfying their demands. However, the lack of credibility of the deterrence argument, combined with the immorality and illegality of house demolitions should serve as an overwhelming reason not to resume this abysmal practice.A mother whose premature twins died while she lay in a coma following a tragic ambulance mix-up has led the tributes among mourners at her daughters' funeral. Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham yesterday in a wheelchair. She was allowed out of hospital especially for the service, which comes after she spent 18 days in a coma only to be told upon regaining consciousness that her daughters had passed away. Scroll down for video . Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham in a wheelchair. She was supported by friends and family at the service for her twin daughters . The white horse-drawn princess carriage carried the coffins to the service at Lodge Hill Crematorium . Pink bunting was draped over the coffins of the twin daughters, with their names Melody and Rose on . The twin girls, Melody and Rose Clarke (pictured above in images released by the family), died from multi-organ failure on November 4 . Wearing her favourite colour red, she was wheeled behind the twins' tiny coffins as they were carried to the crematorium in a white horse-drawn princess carriage. White teddy bears were placed inside the carriage along with matching floral tributes. A card showing a picture of Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin, 31, cradling their tragic twins simply read: 'God Bless you Melody and Rose.' Reverend Denise Jones, who led the service, paid tribute to Melody and Rose saying they were two 'very very special baby girls'. She told the 50-strong congregation: 'They were much loved and wanted twin girls and baby sisters to little Slater. 'The last few weeks have been a journey of great courage, determination and faith. The loss of our children is the most painful thing to ever have to experience in our lives. 'Melody and Rose touched the hearts of all of us here today as well as the community and world and they have left behind a beautiful legacy of love.' Hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sang by the congregation who all dressed in bright colours on the request of Ms Bennett. Mourners were played 'Somewhere over the rainbow' at the end of the 40-minute ceremony. The babies were delivered by emergency caesarean while Ms Bennett fought for life after collapsing at her home in Druids Heath, Birmingham. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she called 999 early in the morning of October 29 after suffering suffered a placental abruption. When paramedics arrived 12 minutes later at 5.51am, she was in such pain that she could not press the door buzzer to let them in.

Funeral of Melody and Rose at Lodge Hill Crematorium, Birmingham. Tragically, her neighbours refused to buzz the ambulance crew into the council-run tower block because they thought the blue flashing lights were from police vans about to raid the flats. When police finally arrived to let the paramedics in, they found Ms Bennett lying unconscious on the floor of flat - 30 minutes after her initial 999 call. She was rushed to hospital where 4lb 1oz Melody and 3lb Rose were born by emergency caesarean. Tragically, while Ms Bennett slipped into a coma, her baby daughters suffered multi-organ failure and their life support was switched off. They passed away on November 4. The devastated father of Ms Bennett, Joe, 54, said yesterday: 'This has been a tragic time for Jocelyn and everybody in the family. 'We are grateful for all the support and glad Jocelyn was able to attend the service. 'There are still questions which need answering as to why the paramedics were unable to get to Jocelyn sooner but today is about saying goodbye to Rose and Melody.' Following their deaths, Mr Bennett wrote a poem for each of the girls. He previously told how neighbours in the block of flats refused to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid. 'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid. 'No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them. 'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place.' Birmingham City Council is investigating why paramedics were unable to gain access to Ms Bennett's home in Pleck House. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and an urgent investigation was commissioned as soon as we were made aware of the matter.' Tributes placed with the coffins from relatives of Ms Bennett offered condolences and love to the family . Rose and Melody were born prematurely and died aged just a few days old due to severe organ failure . The twins' tiny coffins arrived by a horse-drawn princess carriage before floral tributes were placed outside . Prior to their deaths, the Bennett family held a 'Christmas' party for the twin girls and had them christened. Ms Bennett's father, his wife Lorraine, and the girls' father Mr Clarke held a small party in hospital for the twins. Mr Bennett said they documented the party, in which they dressed up in Christmas hats and jumpers, so that they could show Ms Bennett photographs when she awoke from her coma. She came round on November 16. At the time of the party, Mr Bennett said: 'It was all for Joyce for when she comes round. We can show her the children were loved and that they brought love into our lives. 'I don't want her to see sad pictures. They were baptised on the day they were born as we knew that was what Joyce had wanted.' After the party, Mr Bennett and his wife dressed the babies in the clothes their mother had chosen to take them home in. On the day they passed away, the hospital chaplain performed a touching service before the babies were placed in their father's arms for one last cuddle. Mr Bennett and his family held the babies and celebrated an early Christmas with them before their deaths . The devastated father of Ms Bennett, Joe, 54, said: 'This has been a tragic time for Jocelyn and the family' Ms Bennett's rescue was delayed when ambulance crews were unable to get past a locked door at her flat block in Birmingham. She had collapsed by other residents failed to buzz paramedics in on October 29 .When Jose Mourinho answered a question about the new £5billion television contract on Wednesday evening, spontaneous applause broke out in the room from a group of Chelsea fans listening in. ‘When I was living in Italy and Spain I was paying about £200 a month to have the Premier League at my house,’ he said. ‘I think the Premier League is better when I am here.’ He really believes that stuff and so do his legions of supporters. Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea backroom team celebrate the late winner against Everton on Wednesday . Mourinho embraces Branislav Ivanovic after Chelsea's Premier League victory at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho speaks to the media at the post-match press conference on Wednesday night . Sportsmail's team of reporters discuss whether Jose Mourinho's off-the-field antics are starting to harm his and the Premier League's reputations. Click HERE to read. With that razor-sharp quip he walked out, heading back towards the manager’s office at Stamford Bridge to discuss with members of his backroom team the mayhem that occurred on the pitch in the 88th minute. On Thursday night, when the FA announced that Branislav Ivanovic had escaped punishment for throttling Everton substitute James McCarthy and then laying his forehead on him, it was regarded by the club as a major victory. They ignored the rationale, the television pictures that clearly showed referee Jonathan Moss on the scene when Ivanovic grabbed McCarthy round the neck after Gareth Barry had nobbled Willian. The TV images showing Ivanovic’s head make contact with McCarthy’s left ear were inconclusive, according to a panel of three former referees. Because of that, Ivanovic has got off scot-free. This literally is a fight for the title, with Chelsea happy to antagonise the FA, the opposition, officials, TV companies and the rest of the media with this increasingly odd behaviour. Mourinho has everybody on the run and on Thursday it was the turn of the FA to produce a series of statistics in an attempt to disprove his theory that a campaign has been started to destabilise Chelsea. Since 2005, Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle United have been charged six times by the FA for incidents that were not seen by the match official. Manchester United, Stoke City and Chelsea have been charged four times. The idea that there is a vendetta is a myth.

Mourinho (left) and assistant coach Steve Holland get animated against Everton on Wednesday night . Still, given Mourinho’s consistent claims about the injustices in the game, it would certainly help if the FA publicly clarified the position surrounding off-the-ball incidents. Confusion reigns. When he was questioned about Gary Cahill’s off-the-ball kick in the back of Harry Kane at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day, Mourinho responded with a query about Raheem Sterling’s escape for raising his hands to Swansea defender Federico Fernandez. On Tuesday, Mourinho highlighted the FA’s failure to take any action against an unnamed player (Robin van Persie) for the glance at James Tomkins before the Manchester United man elbowed him at Upton Park on Sunday. From time to time, the Chelsea manager tosses in Arsene Wenger’s shove on him at Stamford Bridge on October 5, for which the Arsenal manager went unpunished. The memory plays tricks sometimes and Mourinho’s acolytes have forgotten how miserable life was in the weeks and months before he was sacked by Roman Abramovich in 2007 after drawing 1-1 with Rosenborg. We are close to revisiting that era, returning to a period when English football had earned a rest from the Chelsea manager. Mourinho (right) and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger during a match at Stamford Bridge last October . Mourinho (left) celebrates wildly after Chelsea beat Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium last year . Seven years on they brought him back and just over a year into his five-year deal, nothing has changed. It is a sad day when the normally mild-mannered Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland is seen haranguing the fourth official, as he did repeatedly on Wednesday. With coaching assistant Rui Faria, who fell to his knees and then grasped colleague Silvino Louro in a bearhug after Willian’s dramatic 89th-minute winner, it is to be expected. Now Holland is at it as well. In recent weeks, Chelsea’s technical area has become like the Dog & Duck at chucking out time. Someone needs to call time on it. What happened to winning with dignity or showing a bit of class? What a shame because Chelsea have a brilliant team, seven points clear of Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League and hurtling towards the title. At this rate it is in danger of being tainted.

Why should English football accept this yobbish, boorish behaviour on the touchline from one of the world’s super coaches and his increasingly aggressive assistants? With the exception of Abramovich, there is no one on the Chelsea staff who is prepared to tell Mourinho to fall into line. There is no question who runs the show there. Not only that, he is being allowed to run rings around English football.(CNN) -- Three Delaware day care workers were arrested after police got hold of a "disturbing" and "shocking" cell phone video that, authorities say, shows two toddlers taking part in a fight the workers had organized. Police said Tuesday that they arrested Tiana Harris, 19; Estefania Myers, 21; and Lisa Parker, 47, who have been charged with assault, reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and conspiracy. On Saturday, authorities responded to an unrelated incident and a person whom police would not identify showed them video of the 3-year-old boys fighting in March. The toddlers were not seriously injured, but they were "clearly hurting each other," said Dover Police Capt. Tim Stump. Authorities have not released the video but say one day care worker said "No pinching, only punching" after one of the boys complained that the other had pinched him. The video purportedly shows seven other children seated in the room with their backs to the fighting, according to police. "It's not like they didn't know what was going on, and they were just encouraging them to continue," Stump said. "One of the children attempted to run, but one of the teachers pushes him back into the fray. "We are looking into the possibility that this was not the first time it happened, but it appears to be isolated, and it seems the administration was in the dark about this," he added. Police made the arrests Monday and addressed the incident that evening with parents and guardians of the children who attended the day care center. A spokesman for the state Division of Family Services said the agency dispatched an institutional abuse investigator to work with Dover police during their investigation. "Depending on our findings, these women could be prohibited from working in the public sector, especially with children or senior citizens," agency spokesman Joseph Smack said, adding that all three women had passed background checks before their employment at the center. "It's rare to see a case like this where the staff encouraged this type of behavior," Smack said. Calls to the day care center were not returned, though police say the company's business license has been suspended. The three suspects and their attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment. Police said the women have posted $10,000 bail and are awaiting trial. More from CNN Justice .

Masha Alyokhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova opened their panel discussion at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas . The pair met activists on Friday night to discuss the calls for them to boycott the festival over links between its co-organisers at the St James Ethics Centre and the federal government's asylum seeker strategy. Instead of refusing to attend, the pair said that speaking at the festival would hopefully draw attention to the topic. The members also called on Australia to withdraw its invitation to President Vladimir Putin to attend this year's G20 summit.

Sir Cliff Richard had his privacy violated after a secret deal between police and the BBC to film a raid on his house, a report says. The horrified pop star was left ‘unnecessarily distressed’ after learning police had swooped on his £3.5million home in Berkshire over a sex assault allegation dating from 1985 only when he saw it on TV while in Portugal. Images were beamed live around the world last August from a camera filming from a helicopter. Now a previously unpublished report says the deal between the BBC and the police should never have been done – suggesting Sir Cliff should not have been publicly humiliated in this way. It brands senior officials at South Yorkshire Police incompetent and calls the BBC dishonest for its explanation of how it came to know about the raid. After a BBC reporter approached the force, police chiefs allowed a reporting team including a camera crew to show officers searching the star’s home. The coverage caused a major row, and the findings by independent investigator and former chief constable Andy Trotter will reignite the controversy. Sir Cliff has not been arrested or charged. But many viewers said the BBC coverage made the 74-year-old singer look guilty. The damning report – released to the Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act – concludes: . Mr Trotter says: ‘People have seen a search of Sir Cliff Richard’s apartment unfold on television with details of a serious allegation put into the public domain prior to him being interviewed by the police. Scroll down for video . Coverage: BBC reporter David Sillito outside Sir Cliff's home. His colleague Dan Johnson (not pictured) was invited in for a meeting with senior figures at South Yorkshire Police . Consequence: The deal struck between the force and the BBC led to detailed coverage of the raid on the complex where Sir Cliff had a flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire (pictured), including a news helicopter . The search and the nature of the allegation... certainly interfered with his privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress.’ He concludes that had the force refused to co-operate, the BBC would probably never have run the story. Although the BBC reporter, Dan Johnson, was not interviewed, Mr Trotter decided the corporation had not been fully open about how it came to hear about the allegation against Sir Cliff. The BBC claim – that Mr Johnson had persuaded South Yorkshire Police to agree the deal when all he knew was the name of the celebrity suspect – was ‘not one I believe to be credible’, Mr Trotter said. Evidence supported the police account that Mr Johnson had detailed knowledge and ‘knew as much’ as police did when he made contact. The BBC has never revealed the source of the original information. Up close: The footage of the raid showed several investigators entering and had images inside the house . News event: But Sir Cliff, who maintains his innocence, has not been arrested or charged over the claim . Sir Cliff has called the allegation that he sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in 1985 ‘completely false’. He was interviewed by police under caution and, more than six months on, inquiries are on-going. Mr Trotter was asked to investigate police handling of the raid by police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. Analysis reveals the BBC journalist contacted the force’s communications director Carrie Goodwin on July 14 after an alleged leak from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into abuse claims involving Jimmy Savile. A meeting was held the next day with Mr Johnson and Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who agreed to tell him the date and location of the raid in exchange for him holding the story until that day to protect the investigation. The chief constable was also informed of the agreement. Mr Trotter said Miss Goodwin should not have arranged the meeting with Mr Fenwick, not have confirmed any information about the inquiry to the BBC reporter and not have agreed to notify him of the search. Mr Fenwick should have refused to meet or disclose any details to the BBC. And Chief Constable David Crompton ‘could have rescinded the agreement’. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard.’ The BBC was not directly involved in Mr Trotter’s review. A spokesman said: ‘The home affairs committee has already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story. We have nothing further to add.’ A spokesman for Sir Cliff said he would not comment.(CNN) -- The Supreme Court tried mightily to wade through a cloud of bureaucratic regulations Monday over setting clear air standards, a high-stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the Obama administration against a coalition of states and utilities. The justices on Monday heard six separate appeals, which were consolidated into more than 100 minutes of often dense oral arguments. A ruling is expected by June. At issue is narrow, but potentially far-reaching -- whether the Environmental Protection Agency can tighten emissions standards for "stationary" greenhouse gas sources, such as power plants, in what the administration says is an effort to stem the effects of climate change and global warming. In the larger political sphere, this issue could be major test of executive authority, with many conservative groups painting President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of the legislature. Obama just last week announced new executive rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted the President to act. Republicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing the Obamacare health reform law, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally-married same-sex couples for federal purposes. The high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Supreme Court, in 2007, affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases-- including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions-- are an air pollutant, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. A range of business groups say the agency then improperly extended its regulatory authority to stationary sources. They worry the unchecked, expanded rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. Defining "air pollutant" within the context of greenhouse gases -- and the ability of the EPA to exercise its rulemaking authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- took up much of the courtroom debate. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the half-dozen parties opposing the EPA cannot even agree on defining an "air pollutant" for regulatory purposes . "That to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the" EPA, said Sotomayor. "So if your side can't even come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to the agency?" But Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could prove the court's decisive fifth vote, bluntly addressed U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. "I have to say in reading the brief for the states and reading your brief, I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position," he said. Texas and 16 other the states in the South and Midwest were among the parties whose cases are under review by the high court. The justices had previously rejected three other related appeals, including one from Virginia -- broader challenges to the EPA's power over carbon emissions. A coalition of 15 states backs the White House. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years, and could rule in this case against the administration. But an outcome in this his case was not clear from the arguments. "We have to think about it, along the parameter of separation of powers and whether the way in which the agency has perceived it here has arrogated an exceptional and troubling degree of discretion to design its own climate change program," Peter Keisler, the attorney representing the private groups bringing suit, told the court. Justice Elena Kagan, the most vocal backer of the administration, said the Clean Air Act was originally passed and amended before a clear understanding of the effect greenhouses gases were having on the planet. She said the EPA made a careful determination that they were different from pollution sources that cause breathing and other health problems, such as smog, and could apply different monitoring standards. "What's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the agency has essentially picked one," said Kagan. "It said: 'Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants. Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers.' And why isn't that the more reasonable of the two things to do?" she asked. Verrilli made clear the stakes in his oral presentation, telling the court that greenhouse gas emissions are "an urgent environmental" issue. "It's the gravest environmental problem that we face now as far as EPA's judgment, and it is one that gets worse with the passage of time," he said. But some justices questioned the agency's reach. "Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?" asked Justice Samuel Alito. "Could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases?" After Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts pressed the point, Verrilli suggested the EPA could broaden its discretionary authority, absent a specific congressional mandate. This is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term. The justices in December heard arguments over the EPA's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. A ruling in that case is still pending. Many business groups hope the conservative majority will limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation. The cases argued Monday are Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA (12-1272); Texas v. EPA (12-1269); Southeastern Legal Foundation v. EPA (12-1268); Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation v. EPA (12-1254); American Chemistry Council v. EPA (12-1248); and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (12-1146).By . Ryan Lipman . Perhaps Australian porn star Angela White thought she was bringing the ultimate steamy study fantasy to life when she and a partner secretly filmed sex acts in the library of La Trobe University in Melbourne. The video is believed to have been shot this year, while the library was open for use and has sparked outrage from the university and the ire of police. Despite the presence of nearby students, White starts the video by revealing herself between bookshelves, as reported by the Herald Sun. Raunchy: Angela White and a partner secretly filmed sex acts in the library of La Trobe University in Melbourne . White and her onscreen lover then move to nearby desks, with her partner keeping lookout. A La Trobe University spokesman said it was shocked and appalled by the 'brazen act'. 'We knew nothing about the video footage until we were recently informed by some of our students.'Permission was not sought, nor would it have been given. If requested we would assist fully with any police investigation.' A Victoria Police spokeswoman said if the pair were caught in the act, they could have faced charges including wilful and obscene exposure. 'Brazen act': La Trobe was unaware of the video had been filmed and was left outraged by the embarrassment . On the back of the controversy, Whiteâ€™s Dutch-based production company AGW Entertainment issued a statement addressing the incident and has since removed the video, which had been published online. 'AGW Entertainment B.V. regrets that the filming and/or posting of the video in question may have offended members of the public,â€ .By . Marcus Townend For Mail Online . Roger Charlton is to run Al Kazeem in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday. The six-year-old, a three-time group one winner in 2013, has raced three times since returning to training this summer after encountering fertility problems at stud, winning the 10-furlong Group Three Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor before finishing fifth to The Grey Gatsby in the Irish Champion Stakes last time out. Charlton, whose dual Group Three winning miler Captain Cat tries to win his first Group Two prize in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket on Friday, said: ‘The step up in trip and step down in class is just Al Kazeem needs.’ Al Kazeem will run in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday . Roger Charlton believes the step up in trip and step down in class is just what Al Kazeem needs . The Cumberland Lodge Stakes was an option for Jeremy Noseda’s Grandeur but the gelding, who has run three times without luck across the Atlantic this summer, will again be on his travel with a shot at the $1million Canadian International at Woodbine on October 19. The five-year-old won the Listed Foundation Stakes at Goodwood for the second year running but Noseda will be have to look for a new jockey in Canada. Wednesday’s rider Ryan Moore should be needed for Sir Michael Stoute-trained Hillstar, a winner at Newbury on Saturday. Noseda’s Newmarket colleague Roger Varian may have just won his first Classic with Kingston Hill in the St Leger but there was one surprising omission from his CV. Until Andre Atzeni-ridden 15-8 favourite American Artist passed the post first in the British Stallions Stud Maiden Stakes, Varian had never had a winner at Goodwood from 50 runners in his four-year training career. Varian confirmed that Kingston Hill was on course for a crack at the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on October 5, saying: ‘It is all systems go – I have been very pleased with his since the Leger.’ Roger Varians says Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season . Varian also refused to rule out the possibility that his Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season. Moore was also successful on his father Gary’s Good Luck Charm. That stretched his title race lead to five (142-137) over Richard Hughes, who also picked up a two-day whip ban on runner-up Shadow Rock.(CNN) -- The World Cup's focus on attacking football has won global praise but a cloud scurried across the tournament Tuesday as match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon's participation in the event emerged. The Cameroon Football Association (Fecafoot) has confirmed it's investigating allegations made in the German media that seven of its players were involved in match fixing during the group stages of the World Cup finals in Brazil. While previous investigations centered on trying to fix international friendlies or low-profile qualifiers, this is the first time since 1982 that World Cup group stage games have come under scrutiny. The "Indomitable Lions" were drawn in the same pool as Croatia, Mexico and host nation Brazil, losing all three games. A convicted match fixer spoke to German magazine Der Spiegel correctly predicting one of the results of the African nation. "We wish to inform the general public that, though not yet contacted by FIFA in regards to this affair, our administration has already instructed its Ethics Committee, to further investigate these accusations," said a Fecafoot statement. Wilson Raj Perumal, who was detained by police in Finland earlier this year on an international arrest warrant, told Der Spiegel that Cameroon would lose to Croatia while also having a player sent off. CNN has not been able to independently verify the Der Spiegel report. Midfielder Alex Song was red carded during the game for lashing out at Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic, while goals from Ivica Olic, Ivan Perisic and a brace from Mandzukic without reply secured a 4-0 victory. The match also saw Cameroon players Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Benjamin Moukandjo aggressively confront each other, with television pictures appearing to show Assou-Ekotto attempting to head-butt Moukandjo. CNN contacted Song's agent although he was not immediately available for comment. The Fecafoot statement continued: "Recent allegations of fraud around Cameroon 2014 FIFA World Cup three preliminary games, especially Cameroon vs. Croatia, as well of the 'existence of seven bad apples (in our national team)' do not reflect the values and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of Conduct and the ethics of our nation." In the Der Spiegel interview, Perumal, who CNN is trying to contact, used the expression "seven bad apples." A FIFA spokesperson told reporters Tuesday that they could not comment on whether an investigation was underway on the manipulation of games. Fecafoot meanwhile added in its statement that "in 55 years of existence, it has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind." The investigation marks an uncomfortable end to Cameroon's disastrous World Cup campaign. Players initially refused to board the plane to Brazil until a dispute with Fecafoot over bonus payments was resolved. Although an agreement was eventually reached, the team's departure was delayed by a day. An opening game 1-0 loss to Mexico was followed up by the 4-0 thrashing by Croatia. Hosts Brazil then completed the misery by defeating the four-time African Cup of Nations champion 4-1. In the aftermath of the Croatia defeat, coach Volker Finke described the behavior of some of his players as "unacceptable." "Some players behaved very badly, and that's why we have conceded four goals," Finke said to L'Equipe. "I know that it is difficult to play with 10 men, but that is not a reason to lose it to this point. "The game was balanced until the red card. The Croatians were more clinical in front of goal, but Cameroon also had chances to score. "The behavior of some of the players is really not satisfactory. Even when we were 11-a-side, it was not acceptable." In 1982, Algeria, despite having beaten then West Germany, went out after a seemingly contrived 1-0 win over Austria.Storms Desmond, Eva, Frank and Gertrude all caused major issues in the area, as did a severe but unnamed storm on 27 January.
Hawick, Jedburgh, Newcastleton and Peebles were hit by severe flooding.
The full cost of repairing all the damage has yet to be calculated but the council will get support under the Bellwin Scheme to deal with it.
However, the local authority will have to come up with 0.2% of their net revenue budget as a contribution - which translates to £508,000.
A report to members of the council's executive committee outlined the 240 pieces of work - 114 classed as major - which will have to be undertaken to put things right.

The arrival of American Michael Hopkins and Russians Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky after a six-hour journey returns the station to its full, six-member live-aboard crew. Cosmonauts Kotov and Ryazansky will next month carry the Olympic torch into open space as part of the relay of the Olympic flame ahead of February's Winter Games in the Russian resort of Sochi.

Before that passing milestone however, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazanskiy face more immediate problems. The skeleton crew they are reinforcing was to have overseen the arrival of a commercial cargo ship carrying vital food supplies to the station this week. But a software problem left the unmanned Cygnus freighter unable to receive navigation data properly from the station, delaying the arrival of its 1,300lbs of food and clothes until no earlier than Saturday.

Hopkins, pictured left before the launch, told his mother after arriving at the space station that the journey there 'was a pretty good ride'. Left, the intrepid trio wave as they climb the steps into the Soyuz module . Despite the restocking problems, new arrival Hopkins was upbeat about his mission. During a prelaunch press conference on Tuesday he said: 'As a crew we're very excited to be up there when Cygnus rendezvous and docks and (we're) looking forward to opening that hatch.' He and Ryazanskiy are space rookies making their first flights. Kotov, who will take over command of the station when his compatriot Yurchikhin leaves in November, has made two previous long-duration missions on the station. During their five-month stay, Kotov and Ryazanskiy are scheduled to make three spacewalks, the first of which will include taking the unlit Olympic torch outside the airlock. 'Our goal here is to make it look spectacular,' Kotov, speaking through a translator, told reporters. Kotov added: 'We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work.' The torch is scheduled to be delivered to the station on Nov. 6 by the next crew launching to the outpost. Yurchikhin, Nyberg and Parmitano will then bring it back to Earth when they return home four days later so the traditional torch relay can continue. 'Unfortunately we cannot light it in space so we will simply take it to space and take pictures and some video with the station and the Earth in the background,' Ryazanskiy said in a prelaunch NASA interview.

Shortly after entering the station today, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazansky had a chat via a video-link with their families back at the Baikonur launch pad where they had seen them off more than eight hours before. Radiant but visibly tired, the astronauts were yawning as they were talking to their families. They had been up for about 20 hours. Hopkins' mother described the launch as a 'heart-stopping experience.' 'It was a pretty good ride, mom. It was a lot of fun,' Hopkins replied in the live broadcast on NASA TV.(CNN)  -- Bordeaux clinched the French league title with a 1-0 win over Caen on a dramatic final day of the season. Bordeaux's fans celebrate their first French league title in 10 years. Laurent Blanc's men were ending Lyon's seven-year hold on the domestic championship and winning Bordeaux's first title in 10 years. A goal from Yoan Gouffran early in the second half secured their 11th straight win and their second trophy of the season having won the French League Cup in April. The defeat saw Caen drop to the second flight and kept Bordeaux three points clear of second-placed Marseille who won 4-0 at home to Rennes to keep up the pressure to the last. Senegal international striker Mamadou Niang scored twice with Ivory Coast star  Bakari Kone also on target, but it was not enough. Lyon closed their season with a 0-0 draw at Toulouse and their third place finish secures a place in the qualifying round for the Champions League. Once mighty Nantes also went down despite a 2-1 win over Auxerre, but St.Etienne stayed up with a 4-0 win over Valenciennes. In the Spanish Primera Liga, Atletico Madrid thrashed Almeria 3-0 to clinch a spot in the Champions League next season. Diego Forlan all but sealed the honor of finishing top scorer in the league with the opener for Atletico, his 32nd of the season, by rounding off the scoring for Atletico. Sergio Aguero, reportedly a target for Premier League Chelsea, gave them a 19th-minute lead with Raul Garcia scoring the second. The win draws Atletico level on points with third placed Sevilla, who close their season, but staying two points clear of fifth-placed Villarreal, 3-2 winners over Real Mallorca in their final match. European champions Barcelona, who had already clinched the Spanish title, finished their season with a 1-1 draw at Deportivo La Coruna. Rodolfo Bodipo put Depo ahead in the first half with Samuel Eto'o equalizing with a minute left. It leaves Barcelona with a record tally of 87 points from 38 points, well clear of arch-rivals and deposed champions Real Madrid. Besiktas won the Turkish league title with a 2-1 win over Denizlispor as nearest rivals Sivasspor lost 2-1 to last year's champions Galatasaray. It was the 11th championship for Besiktas, but first since 2003. They also won the Turkish Cup.
